🎓 About the Prototype
Python Quiz Racer is an early-stage prototype of an educational game designed to make learning Python more interactive and fun. Instead of traditional point-and-click quizzes, players use a car controller to drive toward the correct answers to Python-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

This prototype explores how gamification and physical interaction can enhance the programming learning experience.
